# gil-rosario-password-generator
## Description

The password generator app deployed within this repos will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by javascript code that was written on top of the starter code. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. The app will allow for users to generate a random password based upon input provided through the prompts allowing users to not need to think of a complex password on their own. The generator will not provide the same password twice, and will always be randomized.
